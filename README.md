<strong>Learnings & Mistakes</strong>
1. Responsiveness:-
   • do not set the font sizes in 'rem' or 'em' units, try to use 'vw', this will grow or shrink the font according to the screen size

2. Containers:-
   • no need of putting a text element inside a div container, because text elements are itself a container inside which the text items exists.
